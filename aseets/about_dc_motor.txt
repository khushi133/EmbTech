Project Overview:

This project aims to control a DC motor using an ATMega16 AVR microcontroller and the L293D motor driver IC. The L293D is a versatile motor driver that can control two motors independently, allowing for both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation. This setup is ideal for applications requiring precise motor control, such as robotics and automated systems.

Components:

L293D Motor Driver IC:

The L293D is a dual H-bridge motor driver designed to drive small DC motors and stepper motors.
It can control two motors independently, allowing bidirectional rotation.
The IC requires four control signals: two enable pins (EN1 and EN2) and four input pins (IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4).
When the enable pins are pulled high, the respective motor outputs are enabled.
The input pins determine the direction of motor rotation, with specific combinations controlling forward, backward, or brake operations.
Built-in protection diodes handle back EMF from the motors, ensuring safe operation.

DC Motor:

A motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy, utilizing electromagnetic principles.
The interaction between current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields produces rotational motion.
DC motors are widely used in various applications, from household appliances to industrial machinery, providing essential motion and power functionalities.

Working Principle:

The ATMega16 microcontroller sends control signals to the L293D motor driver, which in turn drives the DC motor. The control signals from the microcontroller determine the motor's direction and speed by manipulating the enable and input pins of the L293D. The included code cycles through an array of predefined motor states, updating the motor's operation every second. This allows for a demonstration of different motor behaviors, such as rotating forward, backward, and braking.
