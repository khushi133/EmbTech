Project Overview

This project demonstrates the interfacing of a stepper motor using an AVR ATmega32 microcontroller in Proteus simulation. The objective is to control the stepper motor through programmed sequences, showcasing practical applications of microcontroller-based motor control.

Components

Microcontroller: ATmega32
Motor Driver: ULN2003A
Stepper Motor
Input Devices: 4 Push Buttons (Pull-Up Configuration)
Working Principle

Stepper motors convert electrical pulses into precise mechanical movements. The AVR microcontroller sends control signals to the stepper motor through the ULN2003A motor driver. The motor is driven in half-step and full-step modes, with the sequences controlled by the microcontroller. Each step is timed with delays to ensure accurate motor positioning and stability.
